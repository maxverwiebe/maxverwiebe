### Hi there 👋
I'm Max, a Business and Computer Science B.Sc student based in Germany. Currently, I'm immersed in the world of Web Development and Backend technologies. My toolkit includes NodeJS, MongoDB, Redis, Python, and more.

🚀 I'm passionate about creating seamless and efficient web solutions. Whether it's crafting elegant front-end interfaces or optimizing back-end processes, I enjoy the challenge of bringing ideas to life through code.

🌐 In my coding adventures, I explore the vast landscape of technologies to stay at the forefront of the ever-evolving tech scene. Continuous learning is not just a habit; it's a lifestyle.

💼 By day, I'm a dedicated working student at Thales, where I apply my skills to real-world projects and contribute to meaningful developments.

Let's connect and build something amazing together! Feel free to explore my repositories and don't hesitate to reach out.
